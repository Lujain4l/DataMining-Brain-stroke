The model should leverage the available data to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of stroke and provide insights into the factors associated with stroke occurrence. By achieving this goal, we aim to improve early identification and prevention of strokes, leading to better healthcare strategies and interventions for at-risk individuals.\n\n## The source of the dataset:\n#### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset\n\n",
