# DataMining-Brain-stroke

## Project motivations: 
Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have severe consequences for individuals and society. By working on a brain stroke prediction dataset, we are contributing to the development of a tool that could potentially help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk of stroke and take preventive measures. Studying such a dataset could have a significant impact on public health by potentially reducing the incidence and severity of strokes

## The goal of collecting this dataset:
The objective of this data mining project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of stroke occurrence by employing both classification and clustering techniques. Through classification, we aim to develop predictive models capable of accurately classifying individuals as having a stroke or not based on related attributes. Additionally, through clustering, we seek to uncover underlying patterns and groupings within the data that may provide further insights into stroke risk factors and occurrence. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to identify the most important features contributing to stroke prediction and gain insights into the factors associated with stroke occurrence. Ultimately, this project aims to improve early identification and prevention of strokes, leading to better healthcare strategies and interventions for at-risk individuals
