# DataMining-Brain-stroke

## Project motivations: 
Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have severe consequences for individuals and society. By working on a brain stroke prediction dataset, we are contributing to the development of a tool that could potentially help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk of stroke and take preventive measures. Studying such a dataset could have a significant impact on public health by potentially reducing the incidence and severity of strokes

## The goal of collecting this dataset:
The goal of this data mining project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as having a stroke or not based on related attributes. The model should leverage the available data to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of stroke and provide insights into the factors associated with stroke occurrence. By achieving this goal, we aim to improve early identification and prevention of strokes, leading to better healthcare strategies and interventions for at-risk individuals.
