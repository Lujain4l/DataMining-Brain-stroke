# DataMining-Brain-stroke

## Project motivations: 
Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have severe consequences for individuals and society. By working on a brain stroke prediction dataset, we are contributing to the development of a tool that could potentially help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk of stroke and take preventive measures. Such a dataset could have a significant impact on public health by potentially reducing the incidence and severity of strokes
